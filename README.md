Solve equivalent force-couple systems

Coded in C++, this program will find the following for equivalent force-couple systems:
  - Resultant force (Cartesian vector form)
  - Moment (Cartesian vector form)
  
The following information is needed for the program:
  - SI Unit Types
  - All force values
  - All coordinate values
